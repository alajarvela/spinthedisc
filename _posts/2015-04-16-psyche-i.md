Spin the Disc's debut release is a combined effort between three continents, four countries and nine talented artists to create some sweet, soulful music straight from the heart. 

The album title 'Psyche' comes from Ancient Greek and it translates to 'Soul'. On this release you will hear what the word means to each artist. 

We at Spin the Disc are humbled by the chance to work with so many talented musicians and hope that we can give as much back to each artist and listener in turn.
